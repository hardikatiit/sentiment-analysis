8,Please have more dustbins,-1
9,Promote Terrace gardening along with all the above.. Will bring in additional 10% pollution free environment..,0
10,This plan should be implemented now for next 15 years there will be a lot of population in Bengaluru. Please protect the nature in Bengaluru and do it now,1
11,Vertical gardening and envirnmt structures must be mandated for tech parks..as the glass panes heats up the city..the encroached lakes must be tackled sternly..firstly BDA land allotment must be corruption free and must not allot lands which have issues,-1
12,"There should be more specifics of how are they going to achieve this. There should be some deadlines and some Targets associated with each item. 2031 will be too late for such measures as we have habit of working towards the end of Goal. Some Immediate steps should be taken to get Environment, Back on Track. Relive all the lakes, make all the lakes Non-Toxic, plant more trees around the Lake. Create Green Zones across the Cities, where there should be only plants and no other activities should happen. Work on providing 24*7 Electricity to all the offices and apartments, so that usage of Gensets can be minimized. ",-1
13,"Not only plant but also monitor the growth of trees. Plant more Banyan for larger distribution of trees, and higher o2 content. Also, we have a huge termite problem so we are in dire need of tree doctors at every ward. Lastly, give more breathing space for trees and not choke it with cement. ",-1
14,"Complete disregard for the environment. 
There should be more green spaces in the city.",-1
15,The plan sounds very vague at the moment.,-1
16,"Sound like unrealistic aims for our governments. Battery operated cars have yet to reach that level of sophistication, though it is possible by 2031. Getting people to move on from petrol and diesel will be harder. ",-1
17,"More Gardens, Parks need to be developed if possible every area must have a big garden so that we save environment also this wil control pollution a bit.",0
18,Wat about no. of vehicles on road? Wat about illegal constructions? Concrete city.,-1
19,Move the polluting industries from areas such as peenya to further places designated for them away from populated areas,-1
20,"All roads should be sand free dry. Sand is causing air pollution. Manholes should be designed in a way it is in level with the road, no elevation or depression of the man holes. Too many two wheeler accidents and death is caused by un even level of the man holes on the roads. ",-1

22,"The park and road should be monitored by the Area Authority on monthly basis.They should install proper lighting and maintenance of the platform as well.Tress should be planted more and government should encourage citizen to use cycle more.They should even plan events for cycling and should have Cycle stand and Cycles on rent installed so that the pollution level can come down as well as the parking space issue can be solved.This should start with our Elite Government officials first,so that more and more people will be encouraged by this gesture.",0
23,There are places still in core city of Bangalore which needs immediate action on environment management and caring,-1
24,"Every single citizen should be educated about the Global warming. Use of plastic bags should be banned completely, burning plastics & tires should also be banned. Old vehicles which produces lot of C02 should be scraped. Bycycle should be distributed at all metro stations to reduce the usage of other transports. All the polluting factories should be monitored for any chemical discharge into the lakes or rivers. ",-1
25,"Bangalore is name for trees/plants, parks and beautiful lakes inside city. BBMP is cutting down all plants, covering all lakes in the name of development is not acceptable. We do not need such development where there is no good environment. Do not cut down trees and do development with the available resources only.",-1
26,"Need to make strict rules for not chopping the trees.  BBMP keeps chopping /trimming the trees to keep the electric cables safe.  Instead they can do underground cabling.  Also,  instead of chopping huge trees,  they can use new technologies and relocate those trees.  
Strictly plant 2trees each house.  (breadth and length should be mentioned in guidelines). ",-1
27,Ban of Diesel Vehicles before the city becomes like the National Capital of India,0
28,Becoming worst than ever. Not good for Bangalore,-1
29,The Green Belt is reducing by cutting trees and uncountable constructions. There is no plan to road but big builders make the apartment for possession.,-1
30,How about planting trees with fruits like mango n al...this would b great if v are able to get food in the road,0
31,"The maximum impact to nature and environmental factors is due to the unhandled waste from the posters, ads, paper flyers all littered all around the city. We need a law against littering in the public spaces. We build beautiful bridges and the pillars are full of movie posters and political ads. The trees are also not spared. People put up pins and nails on trees to put there posters of PG ads and other things. Can we please have our city back, beautiful and green and clean without all these litter every where we see.?",-1
32,"Mainly have to stop cutting down the trees, if necessary try to replant those trees to another location where necessary. Contact me for planting tree sampling where necessary for joining hands.",0
33,Banglore should go for strong trees than the exisiting thin and strongless trees breaks down when heavy rain fall.,0
34,"Cutting of trees for absolutely unnecessary reasons makes me furious. The trees are cut for road widening purposes where after couple of metres, the road merges back into a 2 lane road. What is the point? And the size of the trees being cut are enormous (easily 30-50 years old)  and are done in the night so that it is not noticed by any one who is  against it. The amount of shade and protection that these trees give is so much that the road makes you feel like home itself. But so many trees are cut, no one feels to come out during the day time. There is no point in chanting sustainability, saving of water, pollution free, or whatever it is if trees are going to be cut down like this. And after all the cutting, I have never seen any replacement efforts and it hurts me as I cannot do anything alone. Are human beings so selfish that we only care about our present comforts? Are we so stupid that we can't see what this is doing to our earth? I don't mind contributing to make out planet a much greener place. Everyone is so selfish and greedy and lazy that no one wants to do work and only wants money. ",-1
35,"Even though a lot of effort is being done to improve the environment , we still have a filthy  environment. This is due to the indifference and ignorance of the public. We have to use a lot of publicity about achieving a clean and healthy place to live in. TV, Radio , Movie theaters,  all the Government offices, Hospitals, Schools and colleges can be used for conveying strong messages about the donts -like, littering, defecating, urinating, SPITTING,  in public places,  and  heavy fines have to be charged when rules are violated. 
Even though  thin  plastic bags are banned shops and vendors are still using them. 
Emission tests are not carried out by many vehicles .  How do they escape the scrutiny of the police!
There are many BBMP buses emitting black smoke . There should be periodical checks . 
Educationg the public is the first step . ",-1
36,These are ideals cannot see any movement on the ground ideally we should do these things but lakes are still getting encroached heavily polluting industries are still pumping effluents to lakes and other water bodies.,-1
37,Need to walk the talk,0
38,The sooner you start the better it is because planting tree you need minimum of 5years for the tree to grow,0
39,The master plan look promising. But I hope there would be action. IT Projects getting approved in Brookfield area without concerned about traffic. Noise and pollution on the rise. Bad roads are one of the main reason for pollution. Govt can try odd/even formula at least once a week. Private vehicles(unpooled) are allowed at 10AM. Buses should connect IT park.,0
40,Lands of lakes should be reclaimed in full force. Also the reclaimed land has to be turned back into lakes and the water catchment area of the lakes have to be taken over and turned green. This has to happen by force else water will be a major crisis for Bangalore in another 2 years. If we think about using force now we will be left with a city with no water,-1
41,Need to keep the city Clean,0
42,"In the masterplan these ideas looks good unless executed to the true core. We are seeing lakes dying, temperature rising due to warming effects caused by less greenery in our surroundings, Vehicles causing noise and air pollution leading to poor quality of breathable air around us. Not only municipality has to plant more trees it has to be an individual's responsibility to contribute towards the society.",1
43,"Please educate house members, especially house wives about waste segregation and not to tie  garbage in plastic cover and throw. Please ban plastic, before banning please provide ideas and alternatives for groceries packing . All the vendors in Prashanth Nagar areas have plastic.. worst !!",-1
44,Please avoid using some expensive flower plant or ornamental plants. Try to use convenientional trees which which we used to plant in old Bangalore areas. Vertical gardening is also a good idea,-1
45,Please install many public garbage bins.,0
46,there are ample trees being planted nor are there any proper maintenance of parks and lakes. some immense drives should be held to plant more trees along with tech parks every month(suggestion),1
47,highly polluted city,-1
48,"Instead of planting trees, trees are being cut. The proud thing of Bengaluru was trees and alot of trees which is being cut, Bengaluru is losing its pride,its temperature is changed only because of this, IT sectors other people are coming to B'lore and there's no much space left so trees are being cut but when you chop one tree its like taking alot of lives, I request you to please make B'lore as before. Please..",-1
49,Dissatisfied,-1
50,"The problem with a democratic national is that the development plans for the next few decades look brilliant on paper. At the top level of hierarchy, the problems are jot down and addressed with a practical solution.  But it's equally hopeless when it comes to the execution as we move down in the hierarchy. 
There needs to be a strict evaluation of the ongoing plans to curb the wrongdoings and also promote the need for development among the citizens so that the general public can enforce the same by being a part of it voluntarily. 
Gone are the days where we sit idle and blame the government. If we need to see the changes around us, we need to change as well.
Just wishing the government promotes active participation of citizens for the development of cities. ",-1
51,"1. The newly planted tree saplings will take minimum 10 years to become a tree, so the aim should be to preserve the existing flora.
2. While planting new trees, the trees should be sturdy, in the sense, it should not succumb for mild wind guesses after 10 years. 
3. At least 3:1 ratio of plantation should be done for each and every tree that is brought down in the name of development.
4. BDA should restrain from cutting trees just because someone built a shopping complex with the entrance placed in front of the tree. The shopping complex or any building should have been planned to avoid tree felling.
5. Everyone in the city-limit should take prior permission from the environment board before cutting any tree that is there in private or in public areas. The reason and plan of the building should be reviewed and maximum number of trees should be saved. Moreover, for every tree they cut, they should plant at least 2 tree saplings and show then as grown trees at the time of completing the construction project.
To conclude: Aim should be to save the existing trees, rather than planting and waiting for another 10-15 years for them to become trees again.
NOTE: BDA can consider relocation of trees with the latest technology and machines available and followed in few countries.

57,"Bangalore has more borewells and many residential property has more then one and in particular places borewells goes up to 2000 meters approx.it's not right way,as bottom surface get dry due to no water.government need to restrict with borewells after certain meters(*very strictly*) and need to supply water so as to save ground water and need to give awareness the advantages of solar energy",-1
58,"Although all these ideas are novel and can make an impact when implemented properly, no assurance what so ever has been given regarding this and the method of implementation is again up for speculation. Another major drawback is that these measures prevent future degradation but do not include any steps for rehabilitating the currently degrading environment",-1
59,It's important to educate as well as make people practice to plant trees only then will the city improve in. Environmental issues,0
60,"Well, I think solar energy should be widely supported by many people.. and each house should start taking this very seriously. Tesla as a company is doing so much better to the earth through sustainable energy. ",1
61,Everything is good but there should be compulsory CSR responsibility given to every company residing in Bengaluru for managing the environment in the city here by reducing the stress for the BBMP to look after each and everything,0

63,"Planting more and more trees isn't a option anymore, it's become a necessity",1
64,Should stop New extension for construction of buildings.,0
65,Because of the recent changes in Bangalore roads. The roads have been dug up... And many people have fallen sick most of 2017 or have faced breathing problems. Dust gathers everywhere and commuting doesnt only turn hard but next to impossible.,-1
66,Please put down commercialisation of residential areas with an iron hand. This will save our environment greatly and help children to study and play more. Please increase play area for children as at present even branded schools have small play area. Please ban honking by vehicles other than ambulances in the City. There is no need for honking with in the city. Please have one hour study for children every day on environment protection. Their parents are a spoilt lot who also need environmental education. Please Make it compulsory.,0
67,Their should small jungle in every part of bangalore the technique of this jungle is used by HAL where a small 10*20 place will be filled with trees and managed in such a way that their is no place inside by setting up of small mini size to huge trees in a orderly way this will fight pollution and save greenery,0
68,"While all of this sounds great on paper, implementation has always been an issue. The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.

The rampant construction of skywalks in the city is a case in point. These skywalks serve more as advertisement platforms than public utilities.

Also, integration of public transport in terms of accessibility and convenience goes a long way in incentivising the population to forego their private vehicles. 

The authorities have completely neglected this factor while deciding the location of the Cantonment Metro Station despite many valid counters to their technical arguments by select and credible individuals from the society.

The Kempegowda International Airport is 11 years old but we still don’t have a fully functional Metro/Rail system traversing the 40 km distance from the city to the airport. Reliance on private vehicles to reach the airport is expected in such a situation. However, the authorities are more interested in widening Jaymahal Road by removing it’s green cover instead of fast tracking and prioritising the Airport Metro Line.

Transplantation of trees saves the trees. However, it leaves their former/original location bereft of the benefits of their presence and hence causes immense ecological damage.",-1
69,"Tree planting has never been successful. Saplings are planted, money is spent and forgotten. They just wilt away after a few months due to lack of care.",-1

 It should be their responsibility that they should take care of these plants. Those who can make survive 30+ plant reward them. I think there are 8 million people in Bangalore. Let's take 4 million are adult in this. So this count after 10 years  there would be 40 million tree at least. And this would be a great thing for this beautiful and important city.",-1

83,"Just planting is not sufficient, sustaining the existing and maintaining the new plants is the necessary of the hour",0
84,"One of the major issue of continuous urbanisation is the decrease of green coverage. The concrete areas formed by the roofs, roads, parkings create heat islands. Putting trees on the roads might help but the main built area (flat roofs) remain. Why not encouraging green roofs and roof  top cultivation? Coupling this with grey water recycling, will tackle the issue of water scarcity to maintain a green cover.",-1
85,Plant small trees along all roads in around Bangalore and make a dense forest kind of plan so that city gets back it's old charm,0
86,"Bangalore has lost 80% of It's greenery.  Where there is a will there is a way, we can definitely restore the greenery. You need to fix a date and begin the awareness campaign 6 months earlier so there is enough hype and awareness is created for all to participate. Make lakhs of saplings available and start a ""each plant a tree"" campaign. In 10 years time a lot of greenery will be restored. 

Also if the land around Airport can be beautifully landscaped, the entire City should have such landscaping. Let each builder take up the job of landscaping a few areas, in return the govt can offer them advertising space such that it doesn't spoil the beauty of the landscaped area. 

Also we see so many illegal bills stuck all over the city especially flyover pillars. Make it illegal and fine those companies that advertise on walls. ",0

89,"BDA has done good job in assessing environment. A simple and more effective solution would be to involve public in environment protection. Issue a Government Order mandating 1 Tree for every House with minimum of 1200 sq.ft area of land. Apartment complexes can also abide this rule. This will ensure quick implementation of tree cover, and reduce temperature, and increase water resources through rain fall.",0
90,Very good view and thoughts from the government. Cutting down of trees must be made difficult for everyone. The must be guidelines and rules regarding cutting of trees. Just planting new trees will not help unless the old ones are preserved.,1

Its consumes less space and more effective. Infact the space below the Metro lane is now becoming a dumping yard. It can be well maintained too.
2. Maintaining the water beds should be thought off. we see the lakes are been converted to land . Eg: JP nagar Puttenhalli lake which was once a wide spread lake, today is making way for a big apartment to come up. Even with heavy rains this year, there were no signs of water in it. One side the govt passed order to demolish the buildings built on the water bed, and other side the govt itself is granting permissions for covering  the lake.

114,"Tree cutting should be kept to a minimum. During Road widening and flyover construction work, environmental aspects should have a greater say than the financial aspects.

A value has to be places on every tree just like market values are placed on property. ",-1

Look at the Banerghata National Park for an illustration of the problem: its entire north-eastern and northern boundaries are densely built-up right to the park boundary. The BDA's approach to green cover (pg 79) is simply copied and pasted from a best practice elsewhere to give a semblance of concern, as the commercial zoning currently (mal)practiced recognises no need for ever a ward green space.

Levy heavy taxes/charges on these hoardings. Why can't we be like any other international country. They do not use such illegal and ugly looking things in their cities, why should we?, they respect their citizens, do we? This will be a major change in my opinion and restore Bangalore's beauty.

Stress on producing less waste. Educate society about segregation and waste management. You need everyone with you to succeed. Rest waste can be segregated and sorted more easily then. And no garbage collection on roads please!! Good luck!,0
135,Trees should be planted all roads not only major roads.  Ensure minimum one tree per house should be achieved. Segregation of waste and wet waste should be converted in to manure and used for the plantation of trees,0

138,"There is no clear mandate from where citizens can access data. The scare in Delhi and Mumbai is a clear lesson for urban developers that incessant development without planning will have an adverse affect on the economy sooner or later. 

First and foremost, we need real time monitoring systems that can be accessed online. This will ensure accountability. 

Cycling and renewables needs a focus in the city. Bangalore is one of those cities in our country which can easily be converted to the ways of cycling with minimal effort. We need cycling lanes and public sharing systems. The city needs docking points so that people can dock their cycles effectively. There should be days when vehicular traffic is limited to cycles (for healthy people). This will promote a new kind of culture, and will benefit the city in the long run.",-1

Means XYZ authority take cost approval from respective authorities in the name of development which includes bribe for each and every person. This needs to be properly mapped and monitored before executing any plans which will help to have cost effective and qualitative execution. Also there should be strict sessions/syllabus in every school. 
Me being from Kerala State, but feel so bad hearing sarcastic fun on laughing at Bangalore being called garden of the city as it isn't really green. We should give this job to Army personals who are good and maintaining and managing green. Examples - HAL Stretch, Jalahalli Stretch, Ramaiah College Stretch, Brigade  Road towards Kormangala stretch. Entire road and area should beautiful like our Devanahalli Airport Road that should be our target and focus. 

Clean all lakes esp sarjapur lake. If one cuts one trees they should plant 5 trees in return. There should be proper count and agreement on trees. Every garden should be properly managed.  ",0

2. No more projects in Bangalore, convince the company to open in Mysore or any other cities. 
3. Promote e bicycle, since the cost of living near to office is high we stay far and use bike or car. If cost of living reduced we can stay near to office and go by bicycle it's healthy and good for environment.

Third, flyover and metro pillars need to employ vertical gardens. 

Fourth, dust and sand cleaning needs to be implemented using machines that are used internationally. 

Fifth, Desilting and cleaning of lakes and interconnectivity of lakes needs to be introduced if not already existent. Flooding of low lying areas can be dramatically reduced if these are implemented. 

Sixth, charging stations cannot be small establishments and at localised points. They need to be interconnected at metro stations, malls, airport.

Already area within BBMP are overcrowded due to maximum multi storied buildings. No Kaveri water, No 24X7 power supply, No Drainage (UGD) and heavy traffic problem.

A metropolitan city's municipal corporation, public services agencies, planning agency must have enough of a budget to foster citizen direction (not 'inclusion', we are not serfs) to all the sectors (environment, education, health, etc) listed at the start of this document.

BDA has converted these lakes and areas around lakes for residential use to be sold to public. now what is the point of looking at old non-existent lakes. NGT should do a current survey to outline current lakes and try to save them instead. It is duty of BDA to protect the rights of public who have legally purchased the sites based on their life savings and have being pay property tax regularly. If the CDP is approved most of the areas around lakes will lose it's value, BDA should look to compensate to public via its market value as many people have already constructed houses in this areas. BDA should deal this matter very delicately otherwise it will be a catastrophe for all bangaloreans and it will destroy 1/3 bangalore. people will not trust and invest in bangalore anymore.  ",-1

Our homes will be destroyed with any further road widening.  We are senior citizens and built/ bought these homes as our retirement homes.  Also, with earlier road widening, we have already lost 8-10 feet of land and boundary walls, trees and garden for which we were never compensated.  Also, no authority has acknowledged this loss or taken responsibility.  The government needs to protect its citizens who are regular taxpayers and abide by rules and regulations.  
We’re already too close to the road and are now suffering from air and noise pollution, which has lead to skin, respiratory diseases, allergies and further hearing loss.

I don't understand how can NDA give permission to open software parks in main city and expect traffic to reduce and nearby already cramped neighborhood to be in livable conditions. Please use land near Nelamagala so that city can grow towards other cities and help the locals maximum rather developing areas near Karanataka border.

291,"While division of districts for specific use is a good Idea, however considering people move around in from various parts of the city for work specific spaces should be allocated within each district/location for common multi level parkings, and feeder transport provided from that point.

As an example, AECS Layout Brookefiled has a significant space allocated to government offices like Bangalore one, Corporator  office and others. This land should be converted as a Multi level parking cum Bus Stand cum Government offices. All nationalised banks, Nationalised Insurance and other such government and semi government services should be encouraged to have offices there. 

Ground floor can be Bus-Bay, Basement can be Food court,  3-4 floors for parking and rest for offices. The is similar to the Multi use bus stand built in many part of Bangalore, but needs to be replicated on a smaller scale in other places as well.

Feeder transport in form of electric buses, shared taxies and Hire a bike services should also be made available for people to be able to move around in those areas for shopping and other chores. Pavements should be well maintained for people who may want to walk.

296,"During 1995, Bangalore was city of Parks, Gardens, Lakes. By 2018 unfortunately it has be come polluted cement and traffic city. We should use afforestation and restore greenery of Bangalore. One way to make space in existing land, is by political intervention, convert single story homes spread out in a layout to multi-story building and use the space which gets created for planting trees. It will take a strong political will and discussion with residents to bring about this change. City should be designed to support a population of 4-5 million people in 1000 km square. We are (as of 2018) 8.4 million in 700 km square. We should develop sisters cities such as Tumkur and Ramanagar instead of over populating Bangalore. Whether it is pollution, traffic, the root cause of the problem is Population! Whenever an apartment or mall is constructed, area on which trees should be planted should be indicated and made sure of by BDA/BBMP. Bangalore should have world class roads - not pot hole roads. Please request big companies with track records of creating great infrastructure such as L&T and HCC to build roads for Bangalore.",-1

2) due to the above, our houses are dangerously close to the road - air and noise pollution that has lead to ailments such as allergies, skin and respiratory diseases and greater loss of hearing.

3) last but equally important, our homes will be destroyed when further widening happens.  These are our homes built with hard earned money for our lifetime.  Where are we to go?  These periodical threats have made us feel very insecure in our sunset years.

307,"All the above are the big plans which we all know will not kick off. If you really want to do any change seriously, we can give you better solutions. All you need is to implement the present rules strictly. BTP even though doing a great job, there is a long way to go which is not being taken seriously. Ask me for solutions and i can give easy ways to ease the traffic problems. At the first place we need to ease the traffic problems and then think of eradicating it.
Some sample suggesstions: 
1) Uturn Management: where ever there is a uturn , the traffic is held up by rouge cab drivers occcupying all the lanes to take the u turn. All we need to do is setup a barricade  not to let them take that u turn unless they are in the right lane for it. 
2) Bus bays: We need to create bus bays whereever they are not there. Using bus bays avoids the blockages by the BMTC buses near the bus stops.
3) Usage of Bus Bays: We are glad that we have bus bays in some areas. Unfortunately  none of the BMTC drivers use them. They fell that it is their right to block the road. Hosnetly if you set right the BMTC drivers by teaching them some road manners, 20% of Bangalore traffic issues will be resolved. Especially the Volvo drivers, just because they have a high end bus, they feel like they own the road.
4) Foot paths: Foot paths should be cleared of all the encroachments. Especially near the bus stops.

There needs to be more focus on better planned roads and pavements - yes but equal focus must be given towards improving traffic police conditions and more traffic patrolling to ensure that rules are followed. Stricter motor vehicle license tests and proper training for public transport vehicle operators, drivers and private cabs must be put in place along with clear speed limit signs throughout the road network. Not to forget clear lane markings, proper maintenance of roads and making sure that the road works are carried out effectively is also essential and severely lacking at the moment. Parking management is again very crucial. Illegal parking on junctions with underpasses and street markets that are illegally set up on pavements and other main roads must be discouraged with pro-activeness. Also, most new areas that are developed have no proper planning of roads - most cross roads are dead-ends and have no adequate connectivity. There must be properly designed footpaths for pedestrians to encourage local commute on foot for short trips. With dead-end roads without allowance for even foot journey, the most convenient choice is obviously personal vehicles. Lack of parking facilities means vehicles are parked on roads blocking traffic movement and hence more congestion. Restricting parking without providing alternatives is a pointless thing to do. Enforcing these basic things and emphasis on pedestrian and cycle commutes are a great way to build smart cities.",-1

Similarly every major junction, flyover, underpass, bridge, signal.... a bus stop is provided right after or before these places. public stand covering half of the road, then autos stand at bus stops, forcing buses to stop in middle of the road... all this adds to the traffic snarls.  In addition to these proper pedestrian crossings are not provided to public, forcing them to take risky route to cross. Even after all this problem wont be solved, unless proper education is not given to citizen. Hope these suggestions help Bengaluru in making a world class city",-1
364,"Need strict implementation of obeying traffic rules, keeping the lane. Sometimes traffic signals causes jams. Every signal needs to be studied to see if it is causing jam, how many actual seconds of each lane traffic and pedestrian crossing is required. This can avoid unnecessary jams at the signals.",-1
365,"Safety of pedestrians should be given utmost importance, which is not the case today in Bangalore. All roads in the city must have continuous footpaths. No road in the city shall be built without footpaths (in places where there is a need for walking). Footpath should be included as a primary part of road construction. It should be like, road = road for vehicles + footpath. Please see the examples from developed countries. If you take up Germany as an example, a person can walk safely and without getting mud on the shoes almost anywhere in German cities. City development should be from a pedestrian first approach. Only then will people try to use public transport more. There should be safe road crossing facilities in all roads at locations where people need it.

Also please do not try to force impractical traffic rules. Traffic rules should be for the benefit of all, not for fining people more.

Thank you!",-1
366,I am not giving feedback on the masterplan. I am just giving my opinion. Actually new houses are being built with 3+ floors without any car parking and the tenants are parking on the road which causes a big inconvenience to the residences. Road is for driving and not parking. Why can't they build a house with car parking. Why is the BBMP silent on these matters?.,0
367,"There is nothing innovative in the proposal. I propose that we mark U-turn  lanes wherever possible. Also, lot of traffic jams in smaller roads happen because there is no traffic light. Since having traffic light at every intersection is not a possibility, we should implement stop signs that allow traffic from all sides to take turn and progress instead of the current situation of drivers trying to muscle their way through. 

We need to recruit more traffic police for better enforcement of traffic rules. The traffic police should be respected and violators should fear them.",-1
368,These measures would be of little help. There should be an exclusive elevated Express way to International Airport wherein people from all parts of the city can converage into this expressway.

Its already saturated and government is planning to widen the road of varthur to varthur kodi. It will not solve the purpose. I think 1 flyover can solve this problem at varthur kodi junction. 
Flyover from Hope farm till varthur kodi if you are thinking of future else it will be mess as you might build just bridge or underpass at hope farm, it will solve the short term problem not the long term. Density of popluation in whitefield working in IT/ITES/ manufacturing is quite high. You need to think ahead of 10 years. 
I felt bad when i see the current situation where even 1 underpass at kundlahalli takes years . How will you achieve the infra problem. 
There should be peripheral metro also to connect the city which will solve 2 problems traffic, pollution . Like - Whitefield to Electronic city, Electronic city to Nagwara, and hebal to whitefield. That is the only way to control the traffic mess. 
You also need to implement other feeder systems like Rapid transport . I am sure people are ready to pay as we know the everyday struggle to reach to office. 
Few proposals you should pay attention rather than discarding :) 
1. Peripheral metro to connect the city as city expand , it will be more mess. That one should not ignore. ( This is the best solution to solve long term problem not the roads)
2. Build Nice road - Electronic city to Whitefield and whitefield to Hebal. 
3. Flyover from hope farm to varthur kodi to Varthur  , It getting messier
4.Rapid transport - Pod taxis - ( it can be implemented at congested places)- Proposed but need some action on ground. 
5. More training to traffic cops as i find them uneducated about the congestion of traffic. 
6. Kundlahalli junction underpass pending from last 5 years ( if we cant build 1 flyover ,how we will improve the infra ) 
7. Underpass or overbridge at yamlur signal. Its not managable by traffic cops now. I am sure no one paid the attention also. 
8. Tin factory - k.r. puram till 100 feet road indranagar, ( need to have less signals )  
9.Also underpass at HAL signal ,ISRO signal and Leela palace . It is proposed but need to be implemented quickly otherwise it will loose its importance. 


I stay in this part of city east part of city and travel to Indranagar from Whitefield. 
These are few suggestions which you can look upon.

390,Thanks Very good plan with detailed overview,1
391,"With the plan on paper, it's a good plan. The the problem arises in the implementation of the plan. The progress speed and the quality of work provided. We should aim that whatever is being constructed now, may it be roads or anything should easily last for next 20 years. That should be the aim, try to do all the work in the night time, so it's less traffic in the day time.",0
392,"Roads are not good, speed breakers are not required because pot holes are doing the job well, this all makes the traffic slow, and road jams. No lighting, I was surprised a day seeing a street in Koramangala with no street lights. 

If road will be well, traffic will run fast and there will be no jams.

Bangalore is pathetic city in India in terms of traffic management and roads development.",-1
393,"Firstly the traffic condition in our city is going worse. I think people are getting into our city more and more as time goes by. Well, it's high time for us to use electric vehicles. In this era the technology is being developed so well that I feel it's high time for us to shift to the eco friendly vehicles.. HEMP also produces fuel to the vehicle where the environment wouldn't be polluted so there is no need of petrol because it creates too much pollution compared to hemp fuel. Please government, please do take HEMP very seriously. IT CSN CHANGE THE ENTIRE WORLD.",-1
394,My feedback is on metro people traffic. I recently saw a video on how people are stuffed into metro carriages...I feel it's a safety issue.... we need to get double decker metro trains from Silk Board to electronic city and from Silk Board to marhathahalli. we the the traffic from these IT zones will be crazy...we need to plan and get double decker trains for these routes. these double decker trains are currently available in Sydney Australia already.,-1
395,"Should reduce the police checking in every corners.. that makes lot of traffic blocks as well.
And build parking areas as well .. so that people won't park on roadside.. ",-1
396,"Parallely, we need to work on existing infrastructure also. Make a person on a self driven wheel chair the datum. He should be able to independently move around. Do our pavements and pedestrian crossings comply to this requirement? 

Lane marking and signage to indicate, which lane to be maintained for the next turn/straight. Also mark out parking places on the road side. 
Zebra crossings are mostly non-existent. Where they are, they end in a fence or a bush in the divider. Stop lines at red lights with the word STOP not marked. 

Level of assurance of a penalty needs to be much higher. Presently it is so low that people can break the law and get away with it. We need to reduce the probability of getting away. 

Doing future planning and creating new infrastructure is all good. But first take care of the existing. 

Our biggest hinderance to traffic woes is the rate of traffic movement at a junction. We need to work towards increasing the average speed on a green light. Case in point being Marathahalli Bridge. There is no Red light, and the traffic is still clearing very slowly. Address problems like these first.",0
397,Heavy traffic,-1
398,"Bangalorean's perception of city traffic and use of road is like a villager's. It has not gone in to minds of people that this is a megacity and citizens have to behave responsibly. Traffic is a zoo in the city. Master Plan says increasing road density and number of buses. Previous master plans also did this. Did that help? We have ring roads smaller in width than side lanes. Ring roads on commercial complexes on either side. Mega marriage halls on ring roads with no parking basements. Basements in sanctioned plans but either no basement or that is used as shops with help of corrupt officials. BDA makes plan but BBMP sanctions plans for individual complexes, houses etc. My suggestion is start a massive campaign for educating public that this is a mega city and it is doomed if they drive and use private vehicles as they do now. Make parking expensive and put up banners for avoiding loud honks, driving without silencers, over speeding etc. On all main roads, close the medians so that erratic turning is avoided and make exit points atleast one km from each other. Make it compulsory for even high end schools to ferry children through school vans and prohibit their rich parents to ferry them in their Mercs, BMWs. ",-1

As you know long back Delhi gov tried to implement even odd rule which is not that successful, however in Bangalore it will not work and yet we want to overcome the issue

We can try to implement 1car min 2persons at peak time, if any men coming in traffic alone in car then fine has to give and for women's you can just give warnings. from this we are trying to risk there freedom however if we try this only on trafficky areas like silk board etc 
 It will impact a lot and many empty cars will not come n struck in traffic, if they want to go office or home or some entertainment places they can go with there friends n family in 1 car..
And for worst case government can create one app so can the car owners can share there route in map if any riders are present they will get to ride in it for that if necessary involve money or some good credits like you did something to Bangalore u earn this something like that

449,"The focus should be on traffic flow rather than road widening which is a never ending cycle. If people drive in wrong direction and don't follow lanes for turning left or right then any length of width of roads is insufficient. There should be a drive to educate people and enforcement to follow traffic rules. The speed of vehicular movement is slowed down by unauthorized parking on any spot including near the turns, pedestrians crossing every where, vehicles coming in wrong direction, vehicle turning right from the left most lane and left from the right most lane leading to chaos on turnings, very slow movement on traffic signals, un-managed auto movements in every direction. The planned infrastructure looks good on paper but it cannot be sustained without people participation and for that discipline and enforcement is the basic need that is prevalent in every developed country except in India. The master plan should also include a chapter how they plan to handle this basic issue which will increase further with additional number of vehicles on road if not tackled properly. In that case any amount of modern infrastructure will just add to chaos on the roads.

Also, when granting permission to build multistory apartments on narrow lanes of the outer areas, capacity of the roads should be measured and only appropriate number of buildings be allowed or the road capacity should be increased beforehand as it is next to impossible to demolish and residential apartment or other buildings at a later stage and residents have to suffer the never ending traffic blockages throughout the day.  There is no mention of handling this issue in the plan. You may have multiple ring roads but if the roads connecting to these and and other major roads in the city are so congested it will take hours to reach the main roads from small narrow by lanes.

While the work is being done, there has to be alternate plans for diverting the traffic which the govt should have planned for. Every Metro phase completion atleat takes 5-6 years. I guess, we should have done a better job there.


2. The BBMP work on the road repairs is again pain point. the repairs takes 2-3 months to complete. We do not see people working at all no matter at what time of the day you come in there. (eg: JP nagar. signal Near Nandini hotel).
Same is the case with laying a drainage line. does it really take 2 months to complete?

Lets take ORR first, BMTC bus stops are on the roads. These busses does not moved to the sides when they stop. During peak traffic hours, even if the bus stop on the side on the ORR, there will be huge traffic congestion. 
One solution for the problem is to make ORR free from BMTC busses, and to have proper connective of service roads in ORR. Once that's done, all BMTC busses  can run via service roads and make free traffic flow on ORR. This will help to reduce traffic to a great extend ",-1

This way a personnel need not be deployed on junctions and breathe smoke.
2. If the bus/auto stands can be moved out of roads, probably on an elevated station, out of the roads can avoid stopping/slowing of traffic, this can also help authority to do away of the speed breakers.
3. A lot of vehicles, mostly cab drivers, drives on high beam on their headlights which causes a lot of distraction for the fellow commuters.

522,"I am sure the responses for this segment would be in the thousands.
Basics:
1. Remove illegal speed breakers and proper marking on Speed Breakers. Most breakers are not visible until you are almost upon them, especially at night
2.a. On major roads like the ORR, have a 3 ft hedge of shrubs on the divider. This will increase greenery, plus helps night driving as the opposite high beam does not blind drivers. Will reduce night accidents
2.b. Alternatively setup proper signals at major crossings like Kalamandir, JP Morgan, Oriental College etc., to ensure safe crossing for pedestrians.
3. Build FOB at all major pedestrian crossings and setup grills on the divider (at least 150m on each side of the FOB) in the middle to ensure pedestrians will definitely take the FOB
4. Monitor and close gaps forcibly created in dividers by 2 wheelers for a quick U turn.
5. Have small (fixed traffic cone type) dividers setup near turns so that those who need to turn will go into the correct lane and not obstruct the traffic going straight by occupying all the lanes
6. Remove the compulsory helmet rule as it is only facilitating traffic cops to make a quick buck. Taking care of their safety is the rider's responsibility and not the traffic department's. The seat belt and helmet rules are useless in the current Indian mindset. The cops should instead focus on stopping and penalizing those who break other traffic laws like jumping a red light, driving in the opposite lane, etc. as these could prove harmful to other drivers who are following traffic rules.

523,"The problem of Bangalore roads is that we have very few main roads and invariably the whole traffic comes to these roads.

1. One way road.
2. 2 lane road.
3. Signal Free.
4. After every few kilometers it should have a system where traffic can take turns into any 4 direction.
5. Entry into these roads from B and lower category roads to be restricted and should have very well defined way of merging traffic.

Secondly, lane discipline should be enforced and offenders to be booked with heavy penalty. Cameras at all crossings for monitoring and speed cameras in long stretches are must.
Thirdly, all humps must be painted black and white for easy visibility.
Footpaths should be cleared of vendors, transformers, uncovered drains so that padestrians do not have to walk on the road slowing traffic.

In Bangalore,  wherever we go, we find cable TV wires or internet wires loosely hanging on road sides from electric/telephone posts or trees. These cables are laid either by cable TV operators or internet companies. Cables are haphazardly pulled through tree tops and telephone/electric posts to houses/buildings. The left over or unused wires are rolled and kept hanging loosely. Among these there are plenty of unused wires, broken ones dangling touching heads of pedestrians. A child running carelessly or a two wheeler can get entangled with these wires and fall. These companies do not care to remove the old wires/unused wires, laid by them.  

To me it seems, at the present scenario, none of the service providers have a secure stable method of carrying the overhead wires to consumers, other than using electric posts/telephone and trees. A stable infrastructure will be useful for both the companies and to their customers  Otherwise, in the years to come such wires will be on the increase creating mayhem, inconveniencing residents, pedestrians and vehicle drivers.
   
Suggest BBMP or any other agency to provide a permanent/stable infrastructure or  a special  bay for accommodating such cables/wires and rent it out to service providers.  None should be allowed to use electric post or trees for laying cables or internet  wires. You may consider including this item in the master plan, if not already included under any other heads.

534,"Our Traffic system is in a pathetic state. Average peak hour speed between 8:30am-11:30am is about 10-12kms/hr.

Firstly I do not blame the government alone for this problem as citizens are equally responsible for this as we do not follow even the basic traffice rules and common sense is just thrown out of the window when we are in the driving seat, but we should also recognise much of the problems need government to take first initiatives.

So what I propose is that, better traffic management and augmented common services are need of the hour.

1. Traffic violations should be severely dealt with with Impounding of vehicle for weeks or months and the safe keep cost added to fines. Community services should be made part of the fine and repeat violators should be subjected to naming and shaming.

2. Methods should be divised to improve lane driving diciplin and specific training and orientation for 2 wheeler drivers.

3. Corporates occupying large office complexes should be encouraged to devise staggered reporting times for employees to ensure less number of  vehicles at a give time. Further Corporates should also be encouraged to work towards a 30% population of employees working from Home on any give day, unless absolutely required to work from office. Having been in Corporates for 22 years I am confident that it is possible if they try, yes it will have some cost impact but I am confident it will only improve the productivity, which effectively can offset some additional cost.

4. Management and coordination of our shared commute modes like bus and metro needs to improve. Metro where available is a boon but Feeder bus and general bus commute still takes a long time. Traveling on ORR or Richmond road averages between 5-10kms/hr most of t he time during the day, this needs to improve dramatically.

5. Quality of roads are PATHETIC.  However to be positive I believe white topping should improve situation and needs to be done much faster pace, plastic based mix for interior roads should become a norm. And most of all contractors doing the road or civic works should be held accountable which is not the case leading to awful patchwork that doesn't even last a month.

Congestion charges : On single occupant cars during peak house
Last mile connectivity :  BMTC or other players should provide last mile connectivity for people to shed their cars in favour of public transport.
Parking : Adequate parking spaces at Metro stations for Cars/Bikes",-1
555,Poor road management,-1
556,Very bad management of traffic. White topping of kasturinagar to kalyannagar stretch not well planned. Too many potholes. It's dangerous for the two wheeler riders. Traffic at tin factory to kr puram is always jam packed. It's really difficult for the commuters.,-1
557,The more important thing is to expand city limits and distribution of companies based on no of employees,0
558,The city should have pedestrian friendly roads. Some parts of the city should be devoid of any vehicular traffic.,0
559,"One of the major problems faced in Bangalore is parking. Regardless of how well our roads are laid and how much effort our policemen put to regulate traffic, the basic need to park our car doesn't exist in Bangalore. People even park on busy roads and immediately jam traffic. It is important that BDA places high priority in identifying parking garages near Metro stations and bus terminals. Without which, any public transport system is bound to fail. Since public transport is not a door to door facility, it's important to help people park their vehicles safely while they avail the public transport. If these are rolled into a Metro payment card, it will enhance the attractiveness of taking public transportation. 

The other area where BDA and our BTP can help with is to understand traffic patterns and proactively managing traffic lights. In many cases, until and after traffic piles up, people park haphazardly and drive erratically causing the traffic jams. Then when the traffic is piled up, cops try to sort it out. If we have policemen on beats ensuring vehicles are moving along and not blocking traffic early in the day, it could definitely help. ",0
560,"Traffic can be organized well by :

Firstly targeting at the RTO Officers as they issue Driving Licenses blindly, they have to Re-Test all the Drivers Licenses and they will end up correcting the fault in cancelling 50% of illegal licenses issued.

Secondly they should target on all Driving Schools as they provide Driving License in just 20 Hrs of classes which can be opted in 1hr/day for 20 days basis or whichever is convenient but it should sum upto 20 Hours which is totally insane, by this inexperienced riders and drivers on roads there will be only improper lane discipline.",0

576,"One major reason for traffic jam in BLR lack of alternative road. There is often only one road for one particular area. No alternate road is oresent or if its there its too far. In other cities e.g.Pune there are multiple entry and exit points going into any area, spreading traffic evenly. With only single main entry/exit point all traffic is forced to pass through one choking point. For example, Panathur villege area has only one proper entry/exit from ORR. No small roads connecting inner gallis/roads. Everyone who wants to to in Panathur is forced through a small main road. In any other city there would have been multiple entry and exit roads planned for this area. Sadly BLR city planning didnot consider this while approving layouts. This neds to change.",0

Exit from ORR and entry into ORR through the same exit point is a blunder in design. What is being done to remedy the major flaws in the road designs, at least the main arterial roads.",-1
586,"The following are basic reasons for traffic problems in the city:

1. Quality of roads
2. Non accountability of contractors for poor roads
3. Constant digging of roads
4. Poor patch work of roads
5. Delay in inspection of roads and hence greater damage
6. Lack of incentive to use public transport
7. Poor last mile connectivity
8. Major surge in taxi operators and hence 4 wheelers
9. Non existence of limiting vehicle ownership policy
10. Upsurge in 2 wheeler traffic
11. Lack of incentive to walk
12. Existence of corridors of converging traffic and narrowing roads
13. Traffic police is busy fining people than controlling traffic

Here are possible solutions to the above points:

1. Public Accountability of the contractor and the office responsible to ensure road quality - timely inspection and repair, minimum time guarantee being imposed,  usage of apps with location to be able to tag the location of problem and response mechanism along with auto escalation matrix 

2. Build and Incentivise public transport use to major hubs of traffic movement - this includes safe and regular last mile connectivity options, incentivising walking via well kept footpaths, overhead bridges, cycle routes. Without last mile, people will still use private transport or autos and taxis 

3. Phase out 3 wheelers and introduce 4 wheeler autos - the driving behaviour can be curtailed this way

4. Dedicated bus lanes and non private transport areas within the city - de congest rings to increase public transport utilisation

5. Phase out privately owned 2 wheelers. Only logistics organisations can own them. Provided subsidised public transport usage to this part of public. 

6. Private organisations to be forced to implement no 2 wheeler policy. 

7. Employ strict policing mechanisms to ensure smooth traffic flow. Move to digitally secure payments to disband bribes, AI And visual tech for infringement identification, safety driving mechanisms such as high pricing of insurance for drivers based on driving style

8. Identification of traffic flow to specific locations such as tech parks and regulate time of travel. E.g Manyata tech park can operate only after 11 am, while ITPL can operate starting 7 am. These can split peak traffic load

9. Relocation of tech parks to separate small townships that encompass a complete habitat. Will cause responsible development of the area. SEZs need to be identified to incentivise movement, affordable development to be undertaken

This simple system will recharge all the bore wells, open wells and also reduce the incidents of flooding.This has been implemented in many countries successfully and is is solution for the future of our cities.",0
597,"I believe the government should also consider public rainwater harvesting and recharge to offset the huge amount of land that has been paved with roads and concreted over.
My suggestion is to mandatory have bottom stones in roadside drains removed or replaced by seepage gratings every 30 feet. Zain addition there can be recharge pits constructed at low points in roads etc where overflow can be run off in the normal roadside drains. Water recharge by the govt on such a scale would augment small measures by people in their own residences or apartment complexes. If we continue taking out ground water at the rate we currently are and don't do something to recharge this precious resource in a thought out and proactive way our future generations in Bangalore will be doomed.

This is is the basic problem we face, the filth on the corners created by bbmp, the burning which goes unchecked leading to pollution and health hazards and also street dog menace.
All hotels should be having biogas plants to reduce the load of food and wet waste. The abattoirs should have a plan to dispose the remains, all plastic paper, cups, plates should be banned a good idea to come back to earthenware pots and cups.
Streets should be provided with bins at every corner which is easily operable and user friendly. I feel for the garbage handlers, they should be given a decent uniform and gloves for handling such waste.
Finally the disposal is still a problem. By reducing the waste generated and proper segregation and compaction the volume can be brought down and this disposal should be done ward wise rather than taking it through the city spilling all over.

Being the silicon city of India, Multi-pronged approach with advance technologies(like I-DAS) has to be adopted to keep up the pace with the uninterruptible and increasing energy supply. Firstly, to ensure that supply meets demand, sufficient measures should be taken to encourage & augment the  energy sources (preferably renewable energy resources) to incorporate sustainable development agenda 2030. Secondly, to experience uninterruptible power supply BESCOM must take pro-active approaches to arrest the unnecessary shutdown and See that the power is supplied at all times within the prescribed limits. Finally, stringent measures should be adopted to reduce the cost on consumption of electricity and make it affordable & available for everyone in the city by reducing AT&C losses, mitigating Administrative lapses, metering DTC's, avoiding power theft, replacing conductors, suitable locations of sub-stations, etc., For this to happen more colloborative holistic approach is the need of the hour.",-1

All new layouts including government and private layouts, need to be established with underground electricity connectivity. This ensures that the ground level infrastructure is not disturbed and also this method is proven to be more robust and easier to maintain. BESCOM should jointly work with BDA to first build ducts / passages along major roads (e.g. ORR) and ensure that all power systems and transmission lines are laid underground.

Some kids don't even know basic addition. So they can't be blamed. We need to get teachers trained too. Not just female teachers, but male teachers too. Nowadays, teachers don't get the respect that they should. Karnataka can follow the Delhi model wherein public schools are getting improved, also more kids are leaving private schools to join public schools. Improve the infrastructure of the government schools. Digitize all sorts of necessary processes both in government and in private. Education in karnataka is not merely equal to education in Bengaluru. Develop schools in the other districts as well. Don't make school children burden by  carrying such heavy bags. It would be better if this is implemented. Nowadays, school is not a place to learn, but to get a 10th certificate. Let all schools tie up with edu start-ups. Same goes to colleges and universities also. Let certain universities have a MOU with foreign universities. Truly speaking graduating from a VTU college is not worth it compared to NITs and IITs even though considering the fact that karnataka is an educational hub of India.

861,"I am an active volunteer in the educational background and I've been to government schools on a regular basis for around 3 years to engage students in certain recreational activities and also outside the syllabus learning.
I have observed that the government schools lacks:
1. complete infrastructure, 
2. awareness about the importance of education among the students, 
3. interest among teachers. 

The first issue needs urgent attention as few schools lack toilets for students and thus creates an impact on their attendance.

There's also need for basic laboratory facilities so that the students learn science with the help of experiments under supervision. This creates interest among students to pursue the career of their choice.

There needs to be a well stacked library for the students so that they can read inspirational books to develop a good character and become a responsible citizen in the society. 

The students should also be provided with facilities to support their extra-curricular activities like sports, dance, singing, art among others. This gives a great platform and confidence for the students to follow their passion.

The second issue is solved when we provide enough opportunities for the students by solving the first issue. The importance of education should be known to every student and their parents because lot of students drop out of school due to financial or social issues. This needs to addressed by counseling the parents and informing them about the facilities provided by government to promote education.

And the lack of interest among the teachers is a well known issue in government schools. This needs quick attention since a student learns from their teacher. 
Teachers need to be selected based on merit and their interest for teaching. If this is done, the government is successful in promoting education for all.",0
862,Please include a subject on(C.P.C.R)for the school kids.Which includes about first aid to be given to an accident victim.,0
863,First of all education system must change I think it is the solution for all the problems.we must change the way of teaching and the syllabus(considering the present scope) for primary and secondary education,0
864,"Apart from this there needs to be compulsory practice of cleanliness as well as good environmental practices to be done at school levels, educating children and in turn educating parents for a better education and a better Bangalore ",-1
865,"It's not just about the facilities that is important.  Well, we have to engineer the mindsets of the future generations. It's a very important thing for us to do. Our educational system is been bizzare comparatively to other countries and it's a night time for us to really take this up seriously and let's be more open to everything and appreciate individuality in the best way possible. By this, it helps us live in a better and a sensible manner. ",-1
866,It is not enough if more Govt Schools are set up. Problem is no one including economically weaker sections of the society would like to send their children to Govt Schools. So quality of schools should be better. Environmental studies in greater detail should be essential part of curriculum. Children should be made aware of noise and air pollution. There can be incentive for children who walk to schools or use public transport as opposed to getting dropped by parents. This way children will become aware of using public transport. Parents too should be educated on environmental issues periodically.,-1

893,The current education system starting from Primary to x & then to XII today is commercialized and is a business. This needs to stop and true merit needs to be recognized. All Schools/Colleges/Institutions should be banned of any kind of donation.

Hence they can educate them at home until they are 5 or 6yrs old which is safe for parents and kids, it will discourage the greedy education industry, no risk of transport or crime or unhealthy food. So if the government comes up with an online certification or common examination centre where it can provide some assessments or grades for kids especially age 3 to 5 years annually and make it completely legal which will help them in entering primary schools.

I think we need to encourage people to take up sports by creating better parks, or running trails around lakes and preserve them.

Many private players,gyms are making huge money.",0

957,"Parks, squares, open plaza is what makes life in the city bearable or even pleasant. Large parks are important but smaller such public open spaces are essentials! They allow kids to play safely outside,close to their homes , they give a ground for social interactions and strengthen community bonds. They are missing in many areas of Bangalore.This goes in par with guaranteeing safe pedestrian routes and accesses. Instead ofspending so much money on fancy fences and complexe ornemental plantations and paved paths, let the parks be simple and open with a few good trees ( why not fruit trees). There could also be deals between private land owner of empty plots and the municipality to use and maintain those plots as play grounds / parks against a small retribution, for a given duration.",0
958,Open playgrounds are awfully inadequate. Even schools lack enough playgrounds forcing children to take to roads. Playgrounds should be spread across the entire city so that long travel is avoided. Sports equipment may be made available on rent out basis at these grounds for the benefit of youth who cannot afford but have an inclination for sports.,-1

Green parks are there but only for walking and jogging, and that too one park for every 10000 people. Look at BTM Layout, HSR, Jayanagar, Koramangala.

Parks and gardens are the main places where elders get fresh air, peace of mind and new contacts and also source for passing time. 
Therefore enough space has to b ear marked for opening parks with proper seating arrangements , security and staff to maintain them with sincerity.
Above all it shd be seen that most of the time these parks and gardens are kept opened as different sections of the people get chance at different timings depending on their business activities or working hours. 
Fountains shd b compulsorily installed and maintained.

972,There is a need for smaller parks in localities. People cant always access the large parks. Empty sites could be identified and turned into parks for people to walk in the morning and for kids to play. BDA should ensure that every locality/layout has a small park.

THe other side of the ORR (Mahadevpura, Hoodi, Whitefield and other areas) do not have sufficient green cover. We need more public parks, children's play areas, jogging/walking tracks etc. in these areas. This will help to increase tree cover and oxygen levels, which is vital, but will also reduce overall temperature, which in turn will reduce power consumption and also invite more rainfall to aid the water problem.",-1

This ground was once a most wanted field for Football matches, Kabaddi tourney's, Cricket tourney's. But now every ground around Bengaluru is occupied either for some political event or by educational institutions. These should have their restrictions and the BBMP should ensure that a playground id used for a specific purpose and not for any personal event.
